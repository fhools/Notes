Compiling servo on Mac 10.11 failed to build
Need to manually set openssl include directory:
export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2d_1/include/
export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2d_1/

These env variables must be set before build process to be utilized.
Rm .server and .cargo directory if alreadt started build and retry
