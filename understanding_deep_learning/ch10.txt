Dilated conv
    Kernel has gaps introduced between normal weights.
    Can have a larger kerenl size without increasing the number of parameters.
    Can be used to increase the receptive field of the network.


Pooling
    Max pooling means that the maximum value of the kernel is taken
    Average pooling means that the average value of the kernel is taken

    When you have a pooling layer, this reduces the size of the image for the next layer.


In a conv layer, you are only training the weight of the kernel and a bias. The same kenel is used
for the entire image. This is a lot less than the number of parameters of a fully connected layer.


However for 1 conv layer there will be many kernels. Each of these kernel produces a feature map.

So you will have many feature maps in parallel. 


Receptive field
The receptive field of a neuron means the number of "pixels"  of the original image that feed
into that neuron.

As the number of layers increases the receptive field increases as well, because of kernel and stride
and pooling.

So each additional layer is able to see more of the image and thus able to learn more complex features.
