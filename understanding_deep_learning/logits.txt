logits are the raw output in the final layer of a multiclass classification model.

The softmax function is used to convert these raw values into something that looks like a set of
probabilities that all sum to one.

the softmax will exponentiate the logits and then normalize them by dividing by their sum. this is
what turns it into a set of probabilities that sum to one.
