A deep learning network has
    K hidden layers
    Each layer has D_k neurons

    h_k is the activation of layer k
    Beta_k is the bias vector for layer k
    omega_k is the weight matrix for layer k

    D_i is the dimensionality of the input
    D_o is the dimensionality of the output
    
    Beta_K must be the same as output dimensionality
