Sources of errors in a model.

Noise:
        Noise in the training data

Bias:
        The model is not complex enough for the target output

Variance:
        This is the sensitivity of the model to different training data.
        So a small change in training data could result in large changes to the model prediction

        This could be consired as the opposite of bias, where the model is not complex enough.

Bias-variance trade-off
By increasing a models capacity, thereby reducing bias, we also increase the variance that the model produces 


u[x] 
    This is the mean value of the ideal function of whatever we are trying to model. It is
    the expected value of the target function if it was actually perfectly modeled.

    It is a fixed value determined by the true data-generating process!

f_u[x] 
    This is our model's expected value when trained over all possible datasets D.
