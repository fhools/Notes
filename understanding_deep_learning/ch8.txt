Sources of errors in a model.

Noise:
        Noise in the training data

Bias:
        The model is not complex enough for the target output

Variance:
        This is the sensitivity of the model to different training data.
        So a small change in training data could result in large changes to the model prediction

        This could be consired as the opposite of bias, where the model is not complex enough.
