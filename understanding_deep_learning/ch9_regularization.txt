Self-supervised learning
    Generative:
        Remove a portion of input, e.g. a portion of pixels, or  a part of a setence, then
        train the model to generate the missing part.

    Contrastive:
        Compare pairs of example, e.g are two images transformed of one or the other
        Do two setences follow each other in a paragraph?
        Do two audio clips belong to the same speaker?
        Do two documents have the same topic?
