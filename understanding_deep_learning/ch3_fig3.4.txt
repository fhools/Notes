input = [x1, x2]

[x1, x2] dot [w11, w12] = h1

[w11 w12 ]   [x1]     [h1] 
[w21 w22 ] x [x2]   = [h2]
[w31 w32 ]            [h3]    

There are as many column in weight matrix as there are inputs
There are as many rows in weight matrix as there are outputs

so input is 2x1 so weight is 3x2 because 3x2 x 2x1 = 3x1

each of the h1 h2 and h3 are passed through an activation function

then that itself is multiplied by another weight matrix to get the output

since the input for second layer is 3x1 and output is 1x1 then
this weight matrix  is 1x3 because there is 1 output and 3 inputs

ROWS = output!
COLUMNS = input!

Remember that
