# supervised
  means you have inputs and truth output (labels, values) 

# unsupervised
  means you have inputs but no truth output (labels, values)
  instead of learning to map input to output, you learn about the structure 

# reinforcement
  means you have inputs and a reward function (labels, values)


# generative models
    generative models learn the probability distribution of the data, it generates
    new data by sampling from the learned probability distribution.

# latent variables
    transforming a high dimension input into a lower dimensional representation, but still
    retaining the important information. 

    could SVD be considered a latent variable model? the singular values are the latent variables?

    this almost sounds like compression.
    is latent variable lossy or lossless?

# latent variables and image captioning/generation from text
    learn relationionship that matches latent variables of words to latent variables of images
    advantage:
        - less image/word pairs needed to train at lower dimensions
        - more likely to generalize plausible looking images
        - introducing randomness can generate multiple images

# reinforcement learning
    an agent interacts with a 'world'
    via actions
    the actions change the world
    the actions will have a reward

# temporal credit assignment problem
    there is a delay between the action and the reward
    
    chess example
        reward after every move, or at the end of the game?


# deep learning in reinforcement learning
   inputs is the world state
   output is the action

    also known as _policy network_




# segmantic segmentation classification model that outlines the cows in a photo
 this is a 
  - multivariate (because of multiple pixels)
  - binary (because its classifying  whether or not a pixel is a cow, true or false)
  - classification (because its classifying whether or not a pixel is a cow)
  problem

 the input is an image vector of size 256x256x3 (3 because of the RGB channels)
 the output is a vector of size 256x256x1 (1 because its a binary classification)
