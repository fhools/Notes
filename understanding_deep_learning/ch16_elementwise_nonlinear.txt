Equation 16.12 describes a piecewise linear mapping that is used to transform one space into another in a way that is invertible, ensuring that every point in the input space maps to a unique point in the output space. The mapping is defined on the unit interval [0,1] for both input and output. Let's break down how this function works:

The piecewise linear function $ f(h, \phi) $ is defined as:

$$ f(h, \phi) = \left( \sum_{k=1}^{b-1} \phi_k \right) + (hK - b)\phi_b $$

where:
- $$ h $$ is the input value in the interval [0,1].
- $$ \phi $$ represents the parameters of the transformation, where each $$ \phi_k $$ is the slope of the k-th segment of the piecewise function.
- $ K $ is the number of equally sized regions the input domain [0,1] is divided into.
- $b = \lfloor hK \rfloor $$ determines the index of the bin that contains $h $$ The floor function $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor $$ gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $hK $$

This piecewise function works as follows:

1. **Determine the Bin:**
   The value $ hK $$ determines how far along the interval [0,1] the input $ h $ is, and multiplying by $ K $ scales this to the range [0, K]. Taking the floor of this value gives us the bin index $ b $ identifying which segment of the piecewise function $ h $ falls into.

2. **Calculate the Base Height:**
   The first term, $ \sum_{k=1}^{b-1} \phi_k $ adds up the slopes (parameters) of all the bins before the current bin $ b $ This calculates the base height of the piecewise function just before the bin where $ h $ is located.

3. **Add the Increment Within the Bin:**
   The second term, $ (hK - b)\phi_b $ calculates how far $ h $ is into the bin $ b $ and scales this distance by the slope $ \phi_b $ of the bin. This effectively adds the increment within the current bin to the base height.

The function $ f(h, \phi) $ is linear within each bin, with a slope determined by the corresponding $ \phi_k $ The parameters $ \phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_K $ must be positive and sum to 1 to ensure that the function $ f(h, \phi) $ is continuous and maps the input interval [0,1] to the output interval [0,1] in an invertible manner.

This mapping is a simple, yet powerful, way to create a non-linear transformation with a piecewise linear function. It's invertible because each piece is a linear function with a positive slope, ensuring one-to-one mapping and monotonicity, which means the function is always increasing and therefore can be reversed uniquely.


Translation:
The equation is utilizing the floor function where b = floor(h_d*K) to provide nonlinearlity. 

The first term of that function sums up all preceding piecewise slopes.
The second term figures out how far into the bin the input currently is and scales it based on that bin's slope.

The full graph mapes 0.0 - 1.0 to 0.0 - 1.0, but in a nonlinear way, where the slope all add up to 1.0 in the end.

See figure 16.5 for a visual representation of this function.
