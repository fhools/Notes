Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a probability 
function that tells you the probability of a variable is less than or equal
to a value x.

The probability density function (PDF) is the derivative of the CDF. It is NOT
a probability, it tells you how weight or concentration of a probability 
at a given point. You integrate over a range to get the probability.

The uniform canonical distribution is a special case where the PDF is a constnt
1. It is linearly increasing from 0 to 1. The CDF is a straight line from 0 to 1.
