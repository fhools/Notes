h'_d = g[h_d, phi[h_1:d-1]]

g is the transformer (not that transformer!)
phi[...] functions are the conditioners 

phi[..] functions return the parameters to be passed into the transformer

input h is a multivariant sample from the base distribution.

it gets passed through the network and output is a sample from the target distribution.
