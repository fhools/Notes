Variables
    Inputs or outputs of a function of probabily distribution

Parameters
    Well known parameters internal to a function 
    For example for a prob distr the mean and variance are parameters

    Another example is learning rate alpha

Scalars
    lower case letters

Vectors
    lower case bold letters

Matrices/Tensors
    upper case bold letters

Sets
    elements Wrapped in curly braces
    {x, y} 
    \[\{ x_i \mid i = 1, 2, \ldots, I \}\]
    
    Sets are bolded caligraphic letters
    
    \[\mathcal{R}^{D \times E \times F}\]

Functions
    Function name followed by arguments in square brackets
    Name[arguments]

    For example log[x]


argmin_x(f)
    returns the x that minimizes f(x)

Probability
Pr(x)
    Probability of x
Pr(y|x)
    Probability of y given x

Pr(y,x)
    Probability of y and x

Pr(y,x|phi)
    Probability of y and x given phi



Lipschitz constant
||f(z1) - f(z2)|| <= Beta ||z1 - z2||

This says that the rate of change of x is bounded by Beta.


# Some special functions

## Gamma function
gamma = integral of t^(x-1)*e^(-t) dt from 0 to inf.
is a generalization of the factorial function to real numbers

## Dirac delta function
Some kind of strange fuction whose total area is 1.
It is value of zero everywhere except at z = 0 where it is infinite.

So somehow the point at z = 0 contributes all the area of 1.

Uses:
Modeling impulse, or instantaneous forces

Allows use of integral calculus in context where discrete events or action occur

Provides a way to describe systems that have sharp localized effect

## Stirling formula
x! ~= sqrt(2*pi*x)*(x/e)^x

Autocorrelation formula
integral of f(x)*f(x+h) dx

Now take that formula instead  of same f with time lag amd do it for 2 different
functions f and g then you get the cross correlation formula!! Amazing!
