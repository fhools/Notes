# Questions

## Q: What does the following mean:
fn foo(x: impl std::hash::Hash) {}
Answer: The above is equivalent to
fn foo<T: std::hash::Hash>(x: T) {}

Meaning foo is a generic function that takes an argument x, which must implement the Hash trait.
Rust compiler will create a separate implementation for each call of foo with the specific parameter passed to foo.

This is different than:
fn foo(x: dyn std::hash::Hash)

Specificallly the impl part. Hash is a trait, dyn std::hash::Hash would be a 
trait object. 


# Using alternative/faster linker zld
1. Install zld
    brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld   
2. Modify cargo file
vim ~/.cargo/config

```
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/usr/local/bin/zld"]
```

# rust-analyzer
install via:
    brew install rust-analyzer
    (Note: probably not correct to install via brew, shouldnt it be sync with current rust compiler?)
