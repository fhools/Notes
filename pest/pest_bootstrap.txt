pest meta is the pest grammar parser itself.
the grammar.rs file is generated from grammar.pest
the pest_bootstrap binary builds this grammar.rs file 

there is a cargo bootstrap command that builds this 
inside of .cargo/config.toml it defines bootstrap as:
bootstrap = "run --package pest_bootstrap"

the bootstrap/ is the pest_bootstrap crate

derive_parser is the proc macro that generates a parser. it is used as follows:

#[grammar 'my_grammar.pest']
pub struct MyParser;

when derive_parser returns it will a parser struct  
struct MyParser;

there is always an enum Rule

this Rule has all the parsing rules.

It also implements a Parser with that generic parameter Rule:

::pest::Parser<Rule> for MyParser {
 fn parse<'i>(rule: Rule, input: &'i str) -> ::pest::iterators::Pairs<'i, Rule> {
 ....
 ...
 }
 }
