# Pest Crate
The pest crate is the main parser/lexer.

# Meta crate
The meta crate uses the pest sub-crate to parse the PEG parsing grammar.
The meta crate has the PEG parsing grammar defined in grammar.rs which
is generated via the grammar.pest grammar file. 
This generated grammar.rs defines the PestParser.

This PestParser has a parse() method that will return a Pairs result
This Pairs data type can be considered as parse tree.

The main way to utilize the Pairs is to define a AST enum, 
The AST enum has one variant for each Rule, wher each Rule
can be thought of as containing the structure of the AST nodes

A common pattern is that there is a ParseExpr enum
This ParseExpr enum contains Box's to ParseNode

The ParseNode in turn contains a ParseExpr and other metadata like Span


Since the ParseNode and ParseExpr are mutually recursive data structure
this is how the the whole AST can be represented.


# Meta crate AST
Once a Pairs data type is returned, there needs to be something
that can consume the Pairs data structure, which is the generic parse tree
and  converts it into an AST, or any other data structure 

See consume_rules()
