# RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation

This is system that uses an external data source(e.g. a vector database) to 
search an external dataset for relevenat information that can be used to 
augment (add more context) to a prompt that is then fed into a LLM model.

# Vector Database
An database of embeddings that can be searched using a query vector.
The embedding is a a way to represent a subspace of knowledge as a
lower dimensional vector. For example a vector database of words
in a dictinoary, the vectors that represent all colors may be 
clustered together in a subspace of the vector database.
