Pulse Code Modulation
Sample of audio fixed distance apart, a fixed number of possible values 
Nyghist Frequency. The highest sampling rate that can be encoded. Nyghist frequency is half the sampling rate
# Parameters
## 
Sample Rate
8khz is lowest for 4khz audio

## Encoding formats
8-bit linear
8-bit a-law u-law 
    14 bits encoded into 8 bit by sample higher frequency further apart

8-bit encoding usually uses 8khz sampling rate


16-bit or 24-bit
    negative infinity to 0 decibals
    maximum absolute value corresponds to 0 decibals


32-bit float
    1 (0 dB) to -1 (0 dB) 24-bits of resolution
    does not cause clipping


# Number of channels
Interleaving pcm channels in one stream


Raw audio is  1.4 Mbps

Raw vidceo 1080i 700 Mbps
