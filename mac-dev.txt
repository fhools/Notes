Ports vs Homebrew
Ports is a Mac OS X port of debian ports tool from BSD to manage packages.
Homebrew is a native Mac OS X tool that also manages packages.

Ports default install is /opt

Homebrew default install is /usr/local

Homebrew and El Capitain
------------------------
MAC OS X El Capitain has implemented SIP. This means /usr/local now
requires special permissions to write to.

To fix it do the following:
sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local

If /usr/local does not exist:

Reboot into Recovery mode (Hold Cmd+R on boot) & access the Terminal.
In that terminal run: csrutil disable
Reboot back into OS X
Open your Terminal application and execute:
  sudo mkdir /usr/local && sudo chflags norestricted /usr/local && sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local
Reboot back into Recovery Mode & access the Terminal again.
In that terminal execute: csrutil enable
Reboot back into OS X & you'll be able to write to /usr/local & install Homebrew.
