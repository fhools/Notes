# Deep dive into Python logging

Python logging consist of a hierarchy of Logger channels

# Logger class
Represents one channel of logging

The Logger's name consist of a path representing hierarcy of logging.
For example 'inputs.csv', or 'inputs.xls'


# Handler class
Represents a log channel handler. 
A Handler actually does something to the logs outputed on a Logger channel

## Standard Handler classes
  - StreamHandler
  - FileHandler 
  - StreamHandler
  - _StderrHandler

# Filterers
Both Handler and Logger are derived from Filterers
    Filterers let you add and remove filters
    It also has a filter method that utilizes the filters 


# Filter
Is a default filter whose behavior is allow
loggers below its path in the hierarchy. 
That is, this Filter will filter based on it's name
and the record it is filter. That is record.name must
be a child of the Filter instance name

# getLogger
getLogger will look up in the Logger Manager dictionary
a given Logger.

Note: In the explanation below instantiate Logger
really means instantiate the loggerClass or _loggerClass
Logger class, it may be set to a Logger derive class.

If the logger doesn't exist it will create the Logger, 
after it inserts it into the dictionary, it will class
_fixupParent which will instantiate PlaceHolder logger
instances along the parent path up to root.

If the logger sees that the placeholder is already there
it will instantiate Logger and insert it into dict in its place. Then it will
fix up the children and then the parent. Followed by parents 

# Fixing up parents
Make sure that a logger has parent components along the 
path up to root. Parents will be PlaceHolder by default
Set the parent of the logger to the earliest actual Logger
derive class that it finds on the way up to root.
If there is no actual Logger instance, and then the 
root Logger will be it's parent. (This is why in fix up children
the  child's parent's name may not start with name of alogger.) 

# Fixing up children
Fixing up the children means take the placeholder
that was already there. Grab all the children that
the placeholder has kept track of. Set the parent
of those children to the newly created Logger instance

.parent will alawys be a non PlaceHolder! Due to _fixupParent
looking for only Logger instances
