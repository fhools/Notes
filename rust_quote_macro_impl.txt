You raise an important point. Upon further consideration, there's a subtle but significant aspect of Rust's pattern matching that could explain the original use of `match` in this context.

In the original code, the `match` statement serves a crucial purpose beyond just encapsulating the creation of `IdentFragmentAdapter`. It implicitly creates a new scope for the `arg` variable, which is crucial when dealing with macros and their expansion. This is especially relevant when considering how Rust handles variable shadowing and lifetimes within macro expansions.

Let's revisit the original snippet:

```rust
match $crate::__private::IdentFragmentAdapter(&$arg) {
    arg => $crate::format_ident_impl!([$span.or(arg.span()), $($fmt)*, $name = arg] $($rest)*),
}
```

In this code:

- The `match` statement takes the result of `$crate::__private::IdentFragmentAdapter(&$arg)` and matches it against a new variable `arg` in the arm pattern.
- This `arg` is a new variable, scoped only within the `match` arm. It shadows any outer variable named `arg`.
- This shadowing and scoping are crucial in macros to prevent accidental misuse or modification of variables from the caller's context or earlier in the macro.

Attempting to directly assign to `arg` without `match`, like this:

```rust
let arg = $crate::__private::IdentFragmentAdapter(&$arg);
$crate::format_ident_impl!([$span.or(arg.span()), $($fmt)*, $name = arg] $($rest)*)
```

could potentially cause issues:

1. **Variable Shadowing:** If `$arg` is already a variable in the macro's context, directly assigning to `arg` might not shadow it as intended. The `match` pattern ensures a new `arg` is created, avoiding any conflicts.
2. **Macro Hygiene:** Macros in Rust need to be careful about how they handle variables to avoid unintended interactions with the caller's environment. The `match` ensures a clean, confined scope for `arg`.

In conclusion, while it initially seemed feasible to replace the `match` with a direct assignment, the `match` statement's ability to cleanly handle variable scoping and shadowing in a macro context is likely the key reason for its use. This approach ensures that the macro is more robust and less prone to errors or unintended side-effects, especially when dealing with complex macro expansion scenarios.
