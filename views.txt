We will refer to UIViews as Views

Views are hiearchial.

A View can contain subviews.

Each subview has a 3 properties:

frame: The origin and dimensions of a view relative to its superview's
coordinate space.

bounds: The origin and dimension of a view's visible space in its own coordinate space. When the bounds size is changed, so will its frame, but the center will remain the same.

The bound's origin corresponds the portion of the view that is currently visible. This portion is what will be visible at it's frame.


center: The center point of view in the superview's coordinate space. This value will remain unchanged when bounds changes sizes.
