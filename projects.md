# Current books I'm reading
- `Practical Binary Analysis` An awesome book on creating custom binary analysis tools for reverse engineering
and disassembling binary

- `Programming Rusts 2nd edition` A great book to read after reading `The Rust Programming Language`

- `Car Hacking Handbook` - A good summary of the tools and methods used to hack cars. Not very project driven.

- `Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures`
