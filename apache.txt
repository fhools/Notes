# Setting up vhosts (from stackoverflow)
No, as it is you can't do this because there is no way for Apache to determine
the Project1 or AlphaProX part of the path name.

These strings must either be in the URL, or, they must not be in the path. It
would work if the paths were like /Users/stu/Sites/prox/prox_app/ because now
the variable string prox is used. But otherwise Apache has no idea to look under
AlphaProX/, your VirtualDocumentRoot "/Users/stu/Sites/* line won't work.
(Apache is literally looking for a directory named */)

You can make this work if you create a directory like 
/Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases and create symbolic links under that directory
to the actual projects, EG:

mkdir -p /Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases
cd /Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases
ln -s ../site1_app
ln -s ../AlphaProX/prox_app

Then, you'll want your httpd.conf file to look like:

<Virtualhost *:80>
    VirtualDocumentRoot "/Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases/%1_app/"
    ServerName vhosts.local
    ServerAlias *.local
    UseCanonicalName Off
    LogFormat "%V %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b" vcommon
    ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/vhosts-error_log"
    <Directory "/Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</Virtualhost>
Specifically, this line:

VirtualDocumentRoot "/Users/stu/Sites/vhost_aliases/%1_app/"
