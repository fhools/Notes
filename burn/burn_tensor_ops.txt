# trait BasicOps
Tensors implement some basic operations (these are not arithmetic).
tensor/api/base.rs


# Separation of struct creation bound and impl bound
The Tensor is a struct that has generic bound K: TensorKind

The impl Tensor has a different bound K: BasicOps<B>

This is interesting, this means that struct creation can have different bounds
than the impl blocks

The BasicOps trait is a subtrait of TensorKind

The operations on a Tensor forward to the BasicOps implementations

# TensorOps
The main trait for Tensor operations is the TensorOps trait
burn-tensor crate
src/ops/tensor.rs

In each backend you can find the TensorOps impl in:
src/ops/tensor.rs

The TensorOps trait have associated functions, meaning they do not implement
a trait object. Its more of associated tensor operations that all take
The TensorPrimitive impl
